# Space Trash Man
Clean up the solar system in your trusty pickup truck! Unity project for Oculus Rift.

This was for my masters thesis project, 'Travel in Virtual Environments Controlling Orientation with Head and Hand Tracking'.
I created the pickup truck and this small minigame to test different methods of travel in VR. The two implemented and tested methods were:

Gaze Steering 
Using the HMD orientation to control pitch/yaw, combineded with the upper body's left/right tilt to control roll.

Virtual Joysticks
I modelled some virtual hands and mapped them to the Oculus Touch controllers. These have a grip animation which is actuated by the palm trigger on the Touch controllers. These hands can then grab joysticks in the 'cockpit' of the truck to control travel.
