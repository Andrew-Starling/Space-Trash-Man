This was for my masters thesis project, 'Travel in Virtual Environments Controlling Orientation with Head and Hand Tracking'.
I created the pickup truck and this small minigame to test different methods of travel in VR. The two implemented and tested methods were:

Gaze Steering 
Using the HMD orientation to control pitch/yaw, combineded with the upper body's left/right tilt to control roll.

Virtual Joysticks
I modelled some virtual hands and mapped them to the Oculus Touch controllers. These have a grip animation which is actuated by the palm trigger on the Touch controllers. These hands can then grab joysticks in the 'cockpit' of the truck to control travel.
